# YouTube Linking

Scrobbling isn't officially supported by YouTube at the moment, however you can request this feature on their Ideas and Feedback forum [here](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/202347) and [here](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/160721).

Alternatively you can scrobble the music you listen to on YouTube and Youtube Music by using the web scrobbler browser extension:

* [Web Scrobbler for Chrome and Chromium browsers incl. Edge, Opera etc.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scrobbler/hhinaapppaileiechjoiifaancjggfjm), Safari is not supported yet.
* [Web Scrobbler for Firefox ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-scrobbler/)
* [Web Scrobbler website with overview of supported streaming sites](https://web-scrobbler.github.io/)

#### Desktop

There is a [YTMDesktop App](https://ytmdesktop.app/) for Windows, macOS and Linux by an external developer which can scrobble with an internal option in its Integration settings. It also has a [remote control app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.ytmdesktop.remote)for Android devices. Note that album and album artist infos are missing from the scrobbles due to YouTube's API, so you don't get album artwork with your scrobbles. As a [Last.fm Pro user](https://www.last.fm/pro) you could add these missing infos later though by editing your scrobbles.

#### Android

For the YouTube and YouTube Music apps we recommend scrobbling with either [Scroball](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peterjosling.scroball&hl=en_US) or [Pano Scrobbler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble&hl=en_US) You can also request official scrobbling support [here ](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/202347)and [here](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/160721).

#### iOS

Unfortunately scrobbling YouTube on iOS devices isn't supported \(as far as we know\) due to Apple restrictions for external apps accessing third-party sites. Again, we recommend requesting scrobbling integration to the app [here](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/202347) and [here ](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/160721). Your last resort would be manual scrobbling then with the known online tools for your browser like [Universal Scrobbler](https://universalscrobbler.com/), [Open Scrobbler](https://openscrobbler.com/) etc.

#### On Last.fm

You can also play \(and scrobble!\) embedded YouTube music videos on most Last.fm track pages and via the Last.fm radio \(desktop mode only\).

If need be, you can change your playback preferences to YouTube in your account's [website settings](https://www.last.fm/settings/website).
